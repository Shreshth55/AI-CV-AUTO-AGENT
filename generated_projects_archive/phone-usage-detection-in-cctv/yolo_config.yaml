You are a senior YOLO engineer.

Task:
Detect phone usage (person using a mobile phone) in indoor CCTV footage, such as offices or factories.

Design a YOLO training CONFIGURATION including:

1. Model variant (e.g., 'yolov8s', 'yolov8m') and justify the choice.
2. Image size (imgsz).
3. Batch size for a Colab T4 GPU.
4. Number of epochs for a first run, and for a more refined run.
5. Important hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, augmentations settings).
6. Any recommended YOLO training tricks (cosine LR, warmup, etc.).

Output:
First, give a YAML-style block with keys like:
- model
- imgsz
- batch
- epochs
- lr0
- optimizer
etc.

Then give a short explanation in Markdown.
