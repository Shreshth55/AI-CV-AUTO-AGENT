You are a senior MLOps engineer writing a GitHub README for a portfolio project.

Project name: Phone Usage Detection in CCTV

Task:
Detect phone usage (person using a mobile phone) in indoor CCTV footage, such as offices or factories.

Write a README.md including:

1. Title and one-line description.
2. Problem statement and why this CV task matters.
3. High-level architecture as a bullet flow.
4. Tech stack (YOLO, ONNX, TensorRT, Unsloth LLM Planner).
5. How the AI CV Auto-Agent works:
   - input (natural language task)
   - planner (LLM)
   - generated artifacts (dataset plan, config, script, optimization plan)
   - user training & deployment.
6. How to:
   - Set up environment (Colab).
   - Run the planner to generate a project.
   - Train the YOLO model using the generated script.
   - (Optionally) run ONNX/TensorRT optimization.
7. Section for 'Example Task: Phone Usage Detection in CCTV'.
8. Future improvements (better planner, more tasks, automatic training, etc).

Format in Markdown with headings.
